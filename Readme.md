# Yak shave en supreme

This is building myself a static site (generator).

Very WIP.

## Things to do on the "posts" pages

- collect all tags & categories, and organize them (don't need pagination probably)
- make a "full list" probably
- add support for a thumbnail image
- twitter card stuff

## Also have a "projects" thing

- this will look like having a file for each project, and it consists of little "updates" snippets.

## Make an index page

## Style all the things
